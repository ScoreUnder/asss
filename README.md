# asss - Arbitrary Search spiritual successor

Hey there's this ancient program out there called "arbitrary search", which is
really good for finding text strings in ROMs.

It has a few problems though:

1. It's windows-only
2. It's sloooooooow (you can't play around with different strings without
   brewing a cup of char first)
3. It doesn't let you explore the few bytes surrounding the text you searched
   for (which might make false positives more obvious).

I hope to address all of these problems and maybe see what else I can do with this.
